  My game is just a 2d shooter where enemies (Mr.Ellis and younger Andy Kyte holding a violin) shoot at and try to stop a red dog that is trying to get to a red flag to win the game. 
  You can shoot with the space bar and select which direction you'd like to shoot with the arrow keys. (up, left, down, and right) </h3>
